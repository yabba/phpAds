phpAds - The rebirth of the Open Source Ad-Server
=================================================

In the late 1990's Tobias Ratschiller created phpAds.
In the early 2000 the development stucked and a few small groups
forked the source of phpAds and later merged their development
together into the phpAdsNew project.

In the last years the primary maintainers changes the project
name twice. First into "OpenAds" and then into "OpenX".
In the last years OpenX made it from time to time more complicated 
to reach the sources.

In my opinion the development again stucked.
The methods used for coding are more than ten years old.

We need a new start!
